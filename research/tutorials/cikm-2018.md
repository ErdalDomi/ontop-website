CIKM 2018 Tutorial
==================

Semantic Technologies for Data Access and Integration
-----------------------------------------------------

### Presented by 
Diego Calvanese, Guohui Xiao

### Time
Friday, 26 October 2018\
    08:15AM-09:45AM & 10:15AM-11:45AM & 01:00PM-02:30PM

### Abstract
In this tutorial, we cover such principles and the main (semantic)
    technologies underlying OBDA/I. In addition to the theoretical
    underpinning, we provide participants also with a practical hands-on
    experience on state-of-the-art tools. In this way, industry
    practitioners and researchers gain a good understanding of semantic
    technologies for OBDA/I, and are able to deploy them for their data
    access and data integration needs in practical use-cases.

### Schedule

### Target Audience
The target audience of the tutorial are researchers, PhD students,
    and practitioners, who are interested in deepening their theoretical
    understanding of semantic technologies for accessing and integrating
    data, and in getting insight into recent developments in this area.

### Prerequisite Knowledge
We assume from participants basic knowledge on relational database
    foundations (relational model, relational algebra and SQL) and
    technologies (use of relational engines, JDBC). Some knowledge of
    first-order logic might be useful, but is not required to follow the
    tutorial. Similarly, background in Semantic Web standards, such as
    RDF and SPARQL can be of help, although these notions are an
    integral part of the tutorial, and are introduced and discussed in
    the first part.
