# Introduction

Ontop is a framework for ontology based data access (OBDA). It supports SPARQL over
virtual RDF graphs defined through mappings to RDBMS. 

Compiling, packing, testing, etc.
--------------------

The project is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. Compiling,
running the unit tests, building the release binaries all can be done
using maven.  Currently we use Maven 3 and Java 8 to build the
project.
