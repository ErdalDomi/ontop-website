## 5 Research positions on Virtual Knowledge Graphs at KRDB, Univ. Bolzano, Italy

July 2019

The KRDB group at the Faculty of Computer Science of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano/Italy is offering 5 positions at various levels on foundational and applied aspects of the management of virtual knowledge graphs (VKGs), a research area also known as ontology-based data access and integration. The positions address the study, design, and implementation of techniques for query answering, for accessing and integrating linked open data, and for using virtual knowledge graphs to support process mining.

The positions are funded by different research projects (from basic research to academia-industry collaborations) that are currently starting within the [In2Data research group](https://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/in2data/) coordinated by Prof. Diego Calvanese:

 * EU Project INODE on data management infrastructures (3 years)
 * Italian basic research project HOPE on open data publishing (3 years)
 * CHIST-ERA EU Project PACMEL on VKG for process mining (2 years)
 * ESF Project IDEE on data integration in the energy sector (3 years)
 * unibz funded project GeoVKG on geo-spatial VKG (2 years)

We seek highly motivated and ambitious candidates with an MSc or Ph.D. in computer science or closely related fields. Good programming skills and a background on semantic technologies and standards (e.g., RDF, SPARQL, OWL, R2RML) are highly appreciated. The willigness to collaborate across institutional boundaries with partners from both academia and industry is a plus. Successful candidates will also be encouraged to join the development team of the popular open source framework [Ontop](https://ontop.inf.unibz.it). The Ontop team has recently spinned off the startup [Ontopic](https://ontopic.biz/), which provides services and develops technologies for data integration based on VKGs, and has strong ties to the Ontop research team. Ontopic is located in [the novel NOI Techpark of Bolzano](https://noi.bz.it/it/), which provides strong links to the local tech-scene.

The positions should be filled as early as possible and have an initial contract duration of 1 year. However, we are looking for candidates willing to stay for several years, as the positions are renewable and funding is secured.

The positions come with a vibrant international working environment in a great location. The university is located right in the center of [Bolzano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano), [a charming city in the Dolomites (Alps)](https://www.google.com/search?q=bolzano+italy&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch). The region, South Tyrol, is among the top destinations for hikers, cyclists, mountaineers, rock climbers, skiers, etc. And last, as one would expect from any Italian location, food in Bolzano is great.

For an informal discussion about the positions, interested applicants are invited to get in contact immediately with Dr. Guohui Xiao (xiao@inf.unibz.it). The formal calls for the positions are about to be issued.
