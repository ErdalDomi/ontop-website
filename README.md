### Editing the documentation
The source code of the documentation is on [Github](https://github.com/ontop/ontop-docs-src) and is powered by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

To test it on your local machine:

``` bash
# install
yarn global add vuepress # OR npm install -g vuepress

git clone git@github.com:ontop/ontop-docs-src.git
cd ontop-docs-src

# start the local server
yarn docs:dev

# commit your changes and push them back to Github
```

VuePress requires Node.js >= 8.

Once pushed on Github, this public documentation is automatically rebuilt by Travis CI.
